# Fruit 360 dataset

A dataset of images containing fruits and vegetables
This dataset has approx. 131 types of fruits and vegetables images.In this project i have used transfer learning technique and the model which is used is VGG16.
This is a great classification problem which uses Convolution Neural Network to classify objects with high accuracy.

## Installation

Just load the model by this command-
```bash
from keras.model import load_model
model = load_model('fruits-92%-vgg16.h5')
```
## Dataset

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle via this link
 ``` https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits ```

## GCP

I used google colaboratory to train my model.I have provided my model which can be loaded and used directly into any application.

## Resources

Here i have provided ipynb as well as scripted python notebook.
I have directly downloaded the Kaggle dataset in Google colab which is very easy and below link as well as my code can be used for reference for downloading kaggle dataset into google colab.
